Procedure for analyzine DUNE17 data.

David Adams
July 2017

DUNE17 refers to data taken to validate, rank and provide
preliminary calibration for the ADC chips  to be used in the
protoDUNE detector.

At present, chips are being tested at two locations (both at BNL)--the
protoDUNE test stand (PDTS) and the cold electronics test stand (CETS).
These are else where sometimes respectivels referenced as linux and labview.
Tests of early batches of chips were done on the CETS and the plan was
test protoDUNE chips on the PDTS but processing on the latter was slow
and it was discoverd on or around July 18 that the files used here were
acquired with the wrong clock settings.
